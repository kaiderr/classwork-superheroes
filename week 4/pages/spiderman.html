        <p>Peter's story follows that of an everyday teenager trying to get through high school. He struggles with not being popular, being bullied at school, not being rich and famous like other heroes, and above all else, he's just a normal high school student getting through his day. Though he has faced numerous hardships in his life, he still carries an optimistic outlook on life. This, combined with his charisma and character growth, is why Spider-Man has such a huge audience today. </p>
        <p>The character has gone through different iterations throughout time, whether that be through the lens of the comic book character Miles Morales, or through the three separate runs of cinematic movie trilogies. He has appeared in his own video games, movies, animated TV shows, action figures, and much more. Spider-Man is a globally loved character and will inevitably become a timeless classic.</p>
