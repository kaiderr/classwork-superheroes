    <h2>Kingpin: New York's Biggest Crime Boss</h2>

    <main>
        <div class="imgDiv">
            <p>Kingpin is one of Marvel's many villains. He is first introduced as a Spider-Man nemesis in 1967 and later transitioned to be a nemesis for Daredevil and Punisher. He is a mob boss and a crime overlord in the New York sphere. Notorious for his immense size, he's skilled at combat and is extremely strong due to his body being mostly muscle. Though he does not have superhuman abilities, his menacing presence and physical prowess help wield him his power.

        <p>In the MCU, he has appeared in more of the recent installments of Marvel properties. This includes the animated Spiderverse films and the MCU TV shows on Disney+. He's a great antithesis to the over-the-top heroes. His raw strength combined with his temper and wit make him a dangerous foe that's still somehow grounded in reality.</p>
