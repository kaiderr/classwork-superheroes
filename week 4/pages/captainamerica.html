            <p>Captain America is a Marvel Comics superhero, developed in 1940 during WWII. Creator Joe Simon wanted to create a universally loved character during a time of war and unrest. The patriotic fighter emerged onto the comic scene and became a huge success for Marvel. Captain America's first supervillan is Red Skull: a Nazi agent working with the fictional organization HYDRA. Captain America fought amongst the WWII soldiers until an accident caused him to be frozen in ice - and in time - until being recovered in the modern era.</p>

        <p>Steve Rogers is the original Captain America, though there are other characters who take on the title after him. Steve is patriotic and stoic, and will do anything to preserve justice in the world. Characters like Steve became incredibly popular during the war as the hero fought against the same enemies that the U.S. was fighting at the time. As his story progresses, Steve's character arc evolves into a fish-out-of-water story in which he must adapt to the modern world after being rescued from the ice. </p>
