    <h2>Loki: A Norse God of Mischief</h2>

    <main>
        <div class="imgDiv">
            <p>Loki is a mischevious character in Marvel Comics. He is based off the Norse myth in which Loki is a trickster whose brother is Thor, the God of Thunder. Depending on what benefits him more at that time, he is often portrayed as either the villain or an antihero. Though he is charismatic in nature, he can be seen as an outcast when it comes to light that he is not Asgardian like his family. Loki was first put into Timely Comics in 1949 and modernized by Stan Lee in 1962.

        <p>Loki being characterized as an antihero has gained the character a cult following of sorts. In the MCU, he has appeared in numerous titles such as the main villain in <i>The Avengers</i> and even held his own titular show, <i>Loki</i>, in 2021. Marvel's spin on the Norse myths have given new life to the brother characters of Thor and Loki. Familial trauma, jealousy, pride, and growth are all themes that Loki deals with and why viewers are drawn to him.</p>
