    <h2>How did Marvel Comics begin?</h2>

            <p>Marvel Comics is a comic book publishing company that primarily releases plotlines surrounding superheroes and supervillains. The company was founded in 1939 by Martin Goodman and originally was called "Timely Comics." During the initial years, they found great success with the creation of <i>Captain America</i>. It wasn't until about 20 years later that the company would find its stride with the release of <i>The Fantastic Four</i>, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. </p>

        <p>In the modern era, many people know Marvel more for the cinematic universe. The first movie based on a Marvel property was <i>Howard the Duck</i> in 1989, which bombed at the box office. The first initial release of superhero movies that saw financial success started in the early 2000s with releases like <i>X-Men</i>, <i>Daredevil</i>, and <i>The Fantastic Four</i>. Due to licensing deals made during this time, the now iconic "MCU" wouldn't officially begin its rollout until <i>Iron Man</i> was released in 2008. </p>
        <p>With the success of Marvel Studios, more people became avid comic book readers. The comic book realm of the Marvel Universe is much more expansive as it explores thousands of different characters and storylines. </p>
